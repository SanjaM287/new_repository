          <b>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло
            Идворски Пупин;(9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935),</b>
          also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and
          physical chemist. <br /><br />Pupin is best known for his numerous
          patents, including a means of greatlyextending the range of
          long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of
          wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as
          "pupinization"). <br /><br />
          Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for
          Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.

      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the
        village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in
        Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always
        remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography,
        From Immigrant to Inventor (1925): <br />
        <br />
        “My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so
        much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with
        another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much
        wonderful knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get
        unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which
        we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path
        through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”
        Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox
        school, and later to German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in
        high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of
        the best students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential
        and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.
        Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that
        time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin
        had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the
        sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in March
        1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in
        Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States. “When
        I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents
        in my pocket. Had I brought five hundred dollars, instead of five cents,
        my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would
        have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin
        his career until he has spent all the money which he has brought with
        him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of
        prune pie, which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained
        nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it
        would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus
        things, but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in
        each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless;
        it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for
        an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the
        hardships that may be in store for him.”

      <h3>Studies in America and Ph.D</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual
        laborer (most notably at the biscuit factory on Cortlandt Street in
        Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave
        private lectures. After three years of various courses, in the autumn of
        1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia College,
        where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of
        Pupin's predicted that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman,
        and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular
        student, he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He
        graduated with honors in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same
        time. <br />
        <br />
        He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von
        Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to become a
        lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of
        Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave
        detection and current analysis. <br />
        <br />
        Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students,
        especially in the field of physics and mathematics, which gave him a
        diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom
        (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling at the University of
        Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his
        claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is
        incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing
        through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a
        photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube,
        which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through
        rarefied gases, he made successful images on January 2, 1896. Edison
        provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when
        placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty
        times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of
        experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated
        secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a
        lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to
        use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New
        York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of
        his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun
        injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a
        well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an
        hour" which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In
        another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a
        photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed
        through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then
        exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an
        exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if "drawn with pen
        and ink." Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very
        short time.

        Besides his patents he published several dozen scientific disputes,
        articles, reviews and a 396-page autobiography under the name Michael
        Pupin, From Immigrant to Inventor (Scribner's, 1923). He won the annual
        Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. It was published in
        Serbian in 1929 under the title From pastures to scientist (Od pašnjaka
        do naučenjaka).

        Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils",
        followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and
        mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some
        seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the
        American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph
        (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they
        made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand
        led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin
        with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of
        an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly
        extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine
        ones.
